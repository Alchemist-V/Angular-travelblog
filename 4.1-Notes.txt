Hello and welcome to fourth and final section of this learning series.

In this section we are going to learn about to some of the most important aspects of any web app development, doesnt matter
what framework you are on, its more than likely that you will run to these patterns. Alright
1. Routing, In layman terms its basically controlling what URL related to your app lands on which component, but its much more than this
 and thats what we are going to learn about.
2. Is HttpClient support in angular, almost every FE app rely on a BE infra to get data and its makes http calls to get this data. We are going to
learn how angular facilitates this.

so lets get started.


Welcome to first video of this section, 

Agenda:
- What is Routing and need of it?
- Route configuration


Okay!
Lets say we have a new requirement for our travel blog, say we need a dashboard view.
The navigation between the dashboard view and the countries is to be arranged like this (show flow diagram here,
and talk about the flow in the diagram).

Okay,
lets try to break this requirement into two pieces:
1. we need a navigation to facilitate display of various components that we have already created.
2. we need a wrapper component called dashboard, which going forward can also serve as landing view for
our app.

So lets get to first task here:
We will facilitate this navigation between components using routing in angular. Its among few best practices that
configure our router as a seperate top level module.
to do it lets create app-routing module

command: ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app
flat : creates it in app/src
module=app: register this module in the import array of AppModule

Generally, and you would note this too as you code more in angular we dont declare components in routing module,
hence we can remove the declarations and Common modules from import array from the app-routing module.

now we will configure router using the Routes in the RouterModule, so lets import these two and register 
RouterModule in the export array of app-routing module. this ensure router directives are available in 
AppModule components.

Now lets add routes

A typical angular route has two properties:
1. path
2. component

now we intend to navigate to travelled coutries list for path localhost:4200/countries so lets configure the same.

const routes: Routes = [
  {path:'countries', component: IndexListComponent}
];

now for this to be functional we need our router config to be listening to browser changes, we do it by registering 
our config to RouterModule using forRoot method in the import array.

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [ RouterModule ]
})
